# itd
A system to involve Arduino and Max for the purpose of creating interactive experiences. These companion programs allow for starting quickly with making interactive prototypes in a Wizard of Oz approach. Once interactive behaviour has been prototyped and the fidelity of the prototypes increases, this system allows for making direct mappings between sensors and actuators either in the Max realm or the Arduino realm.

Check the source code for instructions.

In order to compile the Arduino code (talkToMax.ino) you will need to download two libraries (download as zip and install with the Arduino IDE library manager):
Cmdmessenger - https://github.com/thijse/Arduino-CmdMessenger
Chainable LEDs - https://github.com/pjpmarques/ChainableLED
